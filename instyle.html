                            In this ideation phase, I focused on preparing Information Architecture to help users
                            understand where they are in the product and where they can get relevant information
                            about a
                            task. <br><br>
                            <b>Why Information Architecture is important?</b><br>Because it provides a high-level
                            view of a product and organizes the overall structure of the app which helps users to
                            quickly and easily identify how to book appointment.

                            problems of the users, but We shouldn't rely only on assumption. We never know everything
                            about the user until and unless we talk to them, What we have to do is do the user research
                            without
                            being Omniscient.
